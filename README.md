## Metadata Model

The OER4SDI metadata model is a profile of the two metadata models ORCA.nrw and OER Commons. I. e. metadata records that conform to the OER4SDI metadata model contain all the essential elements for publishing the OER on one of these platforms. This applies as well to the codelists that support the reuse of existing terms as attribute values.
